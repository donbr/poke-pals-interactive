# 🚀 How do you teach AI Engineering?

I’ve found that the best way isn’t through big frameworks or theory-heavy lectures — it’s by starting with something small, building it step-by-step, and letting the system evolve naturally.

That’s how **PokéPals** came together.

## **Phase 1 — Start Simple (Poke-Pals)**

A basic Next.js app.
No AI. No agents. Just data, UI, and a clear problem space.

The goal wasn’t “build something impressive.”
It was “understand the domain and the constraints.”

## **Phase 2 — Add Intelligence (Poke-Pals Interactive)**

Once the basics felt right, AI fit in more naturally.

I added:

* **Router vs Generator modes**
* **A safety pipeline** so kids get consistent, safe responses
* **Tool contracts** using Zod to keep outputs predictable

Nothing about this was overnight.
Each feature was just the next small improvement.

## **Why I’m Sharing This**

Not because the project is “important,”
but because the **process** is teachable:

Start with something tiny.
Get one piece working.
Improve it.
Repeat.

If you’re helping people learn AI engineering, this approach lowers the pressure and keeps the learning curve humane.

That’s all this is — one example of learning in small steps, made public in case it helps someone else.
